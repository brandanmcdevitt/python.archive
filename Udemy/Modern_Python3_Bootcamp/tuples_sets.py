# Exercises

# 1. Create a variable which is a tuple with the the values 1, 2, 3 and 4 inside.
numbers = (1,2,3,4)

# 2. Create a variable which is a tuple with the the value 1 inside.
value = (1,)

# 3. Create a variable which is the result of the values variable converted to a tuple
static_values = tuple([10,20,30])

# 4. Create a variable which is a set of only the unique values in the stuff list
my_first_set = set([1,3,1,5,2,5,1,2,5])

# 5. Create two sets and show both the union and intersection between both
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
set2= {2,4,5,7,8,9}

print(set1 | set2) # set union between set1 and set2
print(set1.intersection(set2)) # set intersection between set1 and set2
